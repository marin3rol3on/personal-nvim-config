I figured the best way to keep this dot files would be here on gitHub as much as I dislike it
but also, doesn't it just make it easier to share and see how this thing will progress through time?

I've started from zero so many times, with my files and with my life. This is funny, that this file es becoming
somethig akin to a facebook post or something like that, something closer to a journal entry. I've lost pets, tools, people
who I thought would forever be in my life have become complete strangers and I would not have it any other way but I am tired
of losing my dot files.

It's time to make things grow.
